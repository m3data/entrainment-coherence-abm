# Cost Types in Coherence vs Entrainment Dynamics

This document outlines the conceptual cost types not yet explicitly represented in the coherence vs entrainment model, and sketches how expected cost profiles can be *derived* from existing dynamical metrics prior to implementing explicit cost variables.

The intent is to separate:
- **structural dynamics** (already modeled)
- **cost-bearing dynamics** (currently implicit)
- **distributional questions** (who pays, when, and how much)

---

## 1. Why Costs Matter

The current model demonstrates that coherent regimes:
- exhibit lower peak disruption
- recover faster or remain within viability bounds
- tolerate sustained perturbation more effectively than entrained regimes

However, this does **not** imply that coherence is cost-free.

In living systems, resilience is never free. Costs are:
- continuous rather than episodic
- often invisible at the system level
- unevenly distributed across agents
- frequently deferred rather than eliminated

Without making costs explicit, coherence can be misread as strictly superior rather than **differently optimized**.

## 2. Core Cost Categories (Conceptual)

### 2.1 Energetic / Metabolic Cost

**Description**  
The energetic expenditure required to:
- continuously adjust orientation
- resist full synchronisation
- maintain readiness under uncertainty

**Living systems analogue**  
- metabolic flexibility
- autonomic regulation
- immune readiness

**Why coherence incurs this cost**  
Coherent systems remain in motion. They regulate continuously rather than resting in a locked configuration.

**How it appears implicitly in current metrics**
- sustained non-zero baseline variance
- frequent micro-adjustments
- higher movement entropy

**Expected cost profile**
- coherence: steady, bounded cost over time  
- entrainment: minimal cost during calm, large spikes during perturbation and recovery

---

### 2.2 Cognitive / Attentional Cost

**Description**  
The cost of monitoring, interpreting, and responding to local conditions rather than following a global signal.

**Living systems analogue**
- attentional load
- sensory integration effort
- executive control in uncertainty

**Why coherence incurs this cost**
Maintaining identity pull and local responsiveness requires attention and discrimination.

**How it appears implicitly**
- sensitivity to noise
- responsiveness to neighbor heterogeneity
- slower convergence under calm conditions

**Expected cost profile**
- coherence: constant low-to-moderate attentional load  
- entrainment: low attentional load until perturbation, then overload

---

### 2.3 Coordination Friction Cost

**Description**  
The social or organisational friction generated by difference:
- disagreement
- misalignment
- delayed consensus

**Living systems analogue**
- coordination latency
- signalling overhead
- negotiation cost

**Why coherence incurs this cost**
Diversity slows convergence and introduces visible tension.

**How it appears implicitly**
- higher baseline variance
- slower initial coordination
- increased local divergence

**Expected cost profile**
- coherence: visible but bounded friction
- entrainment: suppressed friction that reappears catastrophically under stress

---

### 2.4 Recovery Cost (Reparative Cost)

**Description**  
The resources required to restore viability after disruption.

**Living systems analogue**
- tissue repair
- emotional repair
- institutional rebuilding

**How it appears explicitly**
- recovery-time metric
- peak-deviation metric
- failure to recover regimes

**Expected cost profile**
- coherence: low recovery cost because recovery is continuous
- entrainment: high, concentrated recovery cost after perturbation

This is the cost type most clearly captured by the current model.

---

### 2.5 Inequality of Burden (Distributional Cost)

**Description**  
The uneven distribution of costs across agents:
- brokers
- highly connected nodes
- boundary spanners
- identity-holders

**Living systems analogue**
- keystone species stress
- caregiver burnout
- regulatory bottlenecks

**Why this matters**
Mean system metrics can hide localized exhaustion or failure.

**How it appears implicitly**
- heterogeneity in tie-strength
- heterogeneity in coupling-bias
- differential response to perturbation

**Expected cost profile**
- coherence: chronic burden on specific agents
- entrainment: synchronized burden followed by system-wide collapse

---

## 3. Deriving Expected Cost Profiles from Existing Metrics

Even without explicit cost variables, expected costs can be inferred.

### 3.1 Peak Deviation as Shock Cost Proxy

- High peak deviation implies high instantaneous load
- Especially relevant for entrainment regimes

Interpretation:
> How violently does the system absorb stress?

---

### 3.2 Recovery Time as Repair Cost Proxy

- Long recovery times imply high reparative cost
- Non-recovery implies cost exceeds system capacity

Interpretation:
> How long does the system remain impaired?

---

### 3.3 Baseline Variance as Maintenance Cost Proxy

- Higher baseline variance implies ongoing regulatory effort
- Lower baseline variance implies stored rigidity

Interpretation:
> How much does the system pay to stay adaptable?

---

### 3.4 Amplification Ratios as Cost Efficiency Measure

Comparing entrainment vs coherence:
- peak deviation ratio
- recovery time ratio

Interpretation:
> How efficiently does the system convert perturbation into damage?

---

## 4. Anticipated Tradeoffs

Introducing costs explicitly will likely reveal:

- coherence is more resilient but less efficient under calm conditions
- entrainment is efficient but fragile under stress
- optimal regimes depend on perturbation frequency, not just magnitude

This reframes the core question from:
> “Which regime is better?”

to:
> “Which regime is viable given environmental volatility and available capacity?”

---

## 5. Implications for Future Model Extensions

Explicit cost modeling could include:
- fatigue accumulation
- capacity depletion
- recovery slow-down under repeated stress
- uneven cost distribution across agents

However, the current model already supports **cost-aware interpretation** without these additions.

The next step is not to add cost prematurely, but to be precise about:
- which costs matter
- when they accumulate
- who bears them

---

## 6. Summary

The coherence vs entrainment distinction is not about order vs chaos.
It is about **how costs are paid**:

- continuously or episodically
- locally or globally
- visibly or catastrophically

Making costs explicit will deepen the model, but the structural dynamics already encode their shadows.

This document anchors that insight.
