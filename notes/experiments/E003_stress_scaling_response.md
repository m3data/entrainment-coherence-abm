# Experiment E003: Stress Scaling Response

## Core Question

How do coherence and entrainment regimes scale as perturbation strength increases, holding all else constant?

## Hypothesis

Entrainment will show:

- rapidly increasing peak variance
- superlinear recovery time growth

Coherence will show:

- slower, more linear degradation
- earlier signs of generative incoherence before collapse
